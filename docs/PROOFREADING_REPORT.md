## 9. Specific Issues and Recommendations

### Minor Recommendations (Non-Critical)

#### Recommendation 1: Sentence Length
**Location:** Abstract, line 2
**Current:** *"While recent systems address isolated aspects—MAESTRO [34] focuses on intent conflict resolution, Nokia MantaRay [39] provides RAN-specific autonomy, and Tech Mahindra's LLM [37] targets anomaly detection—no prior work combines end-to-end natural language intent processing with production-grade multi-site orchestration and comprehensive quality assurance."*

**Length:** 46 words
**Recommendation:** Consider splitting into two sentences for readability
**Suggested:** *"Recent systems address isolated aspects: MAESTRO [34] focuses on intent conflict resolution, Nokia MantaRay [39] provides RAN-specific autonomy, and Tech Mahindra's LLM [37] targets anomaly detection. However, no prior work combines end-to-end natural language intent processing with production-grade multi-site orchestration and comprehensive quality assurance."*

**Priority:** Low (current version is acceptable)

---

#### Recommendation 2: Passive Voice Reduction
**Location:** Section IV.A, line 2
**Current:** *"The TMF921 adapter ensures full compliance with TM Forum specifications"*
**Suggestion:** Already in active voice ✅

**Location:** Section V.C
**Current:** *"Automated testing validates complete TMF921 compliance"*
**Suggestion:** Already in active voice ✅

**Result:** Paper uses predominantly active voice ✅

---

#### Recommendation 3: Acronym Overload
**Location:** Abstract
**Count:** LLM, O-RAN, TMF921, 3GPP TS 28.312, TR294A, O2IMS, KRM, SLO (8 acronyms)
**Recommendation:** Consider spelling out 1-2 less critical acronyms in abstract
**Priority:** Low (acceptable for technical paper)

---

#### Recommendation 4: "This work" vs. "Our system"
**Current Usage:** Mixed (both used)
**Recommendation:** Standardize on one for consistency
**Preferred:** "This work" (more formal, better for double-blind)

**Instances to Update:**
- Section III.D: "Our work uniquely..." → "This work uniquely..."
- Section V.A: "Our evaluation..." → "The evaluation..."
- Section VI.A: "Our approach..." → "This approach..."

**Priority:** Medium (improves consistency and anonymity)

---

#### Recommendation 5: Hyphenation Consistency
**Terms to Check:**
- ✅ "intent-driven" (adjective) - Consistent
- ✅ "multi-site" (adjective) - Consistent
- ✅ "production-grade" (adjective) - Consistent
- ✅ "LLM-based" (adjective) - Consistent

**Result:** Hyphenation is consistent ✅

---

#### Recommendation 6: Number Formatting
**Current:**
- 1,000+ ✅
- 98.5% ✅
- 150ms ✅
- 3.2 minutes ✅

**IEEE Style:**
- Numbers < 10: spell out (except with units)
- Numbers ≥ 10: use numerals
- Always use numerals with units

**Check:** Paper follows IEEE style correctly ✅

---

#### Recommendation 7: Citation Bunching
**Location:** Section II.A
**Example:** "Recent advances... [34] [35] [36]"
**IEEE Recommendation:** Use consolidated range: [34]–[36]
**Priority:** Low (both styles acceptable)

---

#### Recommendation 8: Table Formatting
**Tables:** All use consistent IEEE format ✅
**Column Headers:** Bold and centered ✅
**Units:** Clearly indicated ✅
**Borders:** Appropriate use ✅

**Recommendation:** Ensure LaTeX version uses `\toprule`, `\midrule`, `\bottomrule` from `booktabs` package

---

## 10. Spell Check Results

### ✅ Status: NO ERRORS

**Common Technical Terms Verified:**
- [x] orchestration (not orchastration) ✅
- [x] synchronization (not synchronisation) ✅

## 11. LaTeX-Specific Recommendations

### Preparation for LaTeX Conversion

When converting to IEEE LaTeX format:

1. **Math Mode:**

   - Use `\%` for percentage symbol
   - Use `\sim` for approximation (~)

2. **Special Characters:**
   - Use `--` for en-dash (ranges: 1--10)
   - Use `---` for em-dash (clauses)
   - Use ``` for opening quotes
   - Use `''` for closing quotes

3. **References:**
   - Use `\cite{ref1}` not [1]
   - BibTeX entries for all 41 references

4. **Figures:**
   ```latex
   \begin{figure}[ht]
     \centering
     \includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{figures/figure1.pdf}
     \caption{System Architecture Overview}
     \label{fig:architecture}
   \end{figure}
   ```

5. **Tables:**
   ```latex
   \begin{table}[ht]
     \caption{System Comparison}
     \label{tab:comparison}
     \centering
     \begin{tabular}{lcccc}
       \toprule
       System & Intent & LLM & Multi-Site & Production \\
       \midrule
       ...
