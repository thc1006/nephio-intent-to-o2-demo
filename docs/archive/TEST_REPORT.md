## Issues & Recommendations

### Minor Issues:
1. **Gitea Access:** Gitea service not accessible on expected port
   - **Impact:** Low - May affect GitOps operations
   - **Recommendation:** Verify Gitea deployment or update configuration

2. **Test Coverage:** Some operator components have low test coverage
   - **Impact:** Low - Core functionality tested
   - **Recommendation:** Increase test coverage for production readiness

### Configuration Notes:
- System is configured for development mode (unsigned images allowed)
- Using local kind cluster for testing
- Git configured with proper identity for commits

## Demo Readiness Assessment

### ✅ Ready for Demo:
1. **Intent Pipeline:** Full pipeline from TMF921 → 3GPP TS 28.312 → KRM working
2. **Security Validation:** Supply chain security checks passing
3. **SLO Monitoring:** Metrics collection and validation functional
4. **Quick Demo:** Automated demo script executes successfully
5. **Operator:** Core operator functionality tested and working

### ⚠️ Pre-Demo Checklist:
1. Verify Gitea service status if GitOps features are needed
2. Ensure VM1 (LLM Service) and VM4 (Edge Site 2) connectivity if multi-site demo planned
3. Clear previous artifacts: `rm -rf artifacts/$(date +%Y%m%d)*`
4. Set environment variables for demo mode

## Test Commands for Verification

```bash
# Run quick demo
./scripts/demo_quick.sh

# Check precheck validation
./scripts/precheck.sh

# Test intent compiler
echo '{"service": "demo-app", "replicas": 3}' | python3 tools/intent-compiler/translate.py

# Run operator tests
cd operator && make test

# Check system connectivity
source scripts/env.sh
ping -c 1 $VM2_IP
```

## Conclusion
**System Status: DEMO READY** ✅

The Nephio Intent-to-O2 Demo system has been thoroughly tested and is operational. All critical components are functioning correctly. The minor issues identified (Gitea connectivity) do not impact the core demo functionality. The system successfully demonstrates:
- Intent-driven orchestration
- TMF921 to 3GPP TS 28.312 compliance
- Security-first approach
- SLO-gated deployments
- Automated rollback capabilities

**Recommendation:** Proceed with demo after addressing the pre-demo checklist items.
