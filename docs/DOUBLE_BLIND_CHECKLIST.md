## 14. Final Pre-Submission Checklist

### Must Complete Before Submission

- [x] Search paper for author names → **NONE FOUND** ✅
- [x] Search paper for institution names → **NONE FOUND** ✅
- [x] Search paper for email addresses → **NONE FOUND** ✅
- [x] Search paper for specific URLs → **ANONYMIZED** ✅
- [x] Search paper for grant numbers → **NONE FOUND** ✅

grep -i "university\|college\|institute" IEEE_PAPER_2025_ANONYMOUS.md
grep -i "@.*\.\(com\|edu\|org\)" IEEE_PAPER_2025_ANONYMOUS.md
grep -i "http://.*\(github\|gitlab\)" IEEE_PAPER_2025_ANONYMOUS.md
grep -E "\b[A-Z][a-z]+ University\b" IEEE_PAPER_2025_ANONYMOUS.md
```

## 15. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ Things NOT to Do

1. **Don't use "we" excessively** - prefer "the system", "this work"
   - Current paper: Uses mix of "we" and "the system" ✅ Acceptable

2. **Don't reference internal code names** - use generic descriptions
   - Checked: No internal code names found ✅

3. **Don't include screenshots with usernames** - anonymize or redraw
   - N/A: No screenshots in paper ✅

4. **Don't cite your own papers in a way that reveals identity**
   - Example: "In [5], we showed..." → Change to "Reference [5] showed..."
   - Checked: No such patterns found ✅

5. **Don't include acknowledgments to specific individuals**
   - Current: Generic acknowledgments only ✅

grep -iE "(john|jane|smith|doe)" IEEE_PAPER_2025_ANONYMOUS.md && echo "⚠️  Potential name found!"

# Check for institutions
echo "[2] Checking for institution names..."
grep -iE "(university|college|institute|laboratory|company|corporation)" IEEE_PAPER_2025_ANONYMOUS.md | grep -v "TM Forum" | grep -v "O-RAN Alliance"

# Check for emails
echo "[3] Checking for email addresses..."
grep -E "[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}" IEEE_PAPER_2025_ANONYMOUS.md && echo "⚠️  Email found!"

# Check for URLs
echo "[4] Checking for identifying URLs..."
grep -E "https?://github\.com/[^/]+" IEEE_PAPER_2025_ANONYMOUS.md && echo "⚠️  GitHub URL found!"

# Check for grant numbers
