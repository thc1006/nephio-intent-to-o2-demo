\begin{abstract}
This paper presents the first production-ready intent-driven orchestration system for O-RAN networks that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to bridge the semantic gap between natural language business intent and technical infrastructure deployment. Our system advances beyond current state-of-the-art by integrating with Nephio Release 4 GenAI capabilities, implementing the latest TMF921 Intent Management API and O-RAN O2IMS Interface Specification v3.0, while achieving 92\% reduction in deployment time compared to traditional manual processes. The architecture integrates Claude Code CLI for intent processing, OrchestRAN-inspired network intelligence orchestration, and multi-site GitOps for consistent edge deployment across distributed sites. Experimental validation demonstrates intent processing latency of 125ms (95\% confidence interval: 120-130ms), deployment success rate of 99.2\% ($\sigma = 0.6\%$), and automatic rollback capability with mean recovery time of 2.8 minutes ($\sigma = 0.3$ min). Our key contributions include a novel LLM-integrated intent-to-infrastructure pipeline aligned with Nephio R4 GenAI vision, complete O2IMS v3.0 compliance, comprehensive SLO-gated deployment validation framework with OrchestRAN-based intelligence, and empirical analysis of autonomous network operations in production environments. This work demonstrates operator-grade automation while maintaining strict quality assurance through systematic rollback mechanisms, positioned at the forefront of September 2025 network automation research.
