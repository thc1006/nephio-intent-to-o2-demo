## Rationale

These files were moved to maintain a clean, production-ready repository structure while preserving historical development artifacts. The main repository now contains only:

- Essential configuration files (AUTHORITATIVE_NETWORK_CONFIG.md)
- Core architecture documentation (SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE_HLA.md)
- User-facing guides (README.md, SUMMIT_DEMO_GUIDE.md)
- Version history (CHANGELOG.md)
- Operational procedures (TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
- Project configuration (CLAUDE.md)

## Recovery

If any of these archived files are needed, they can be restored by moving them back to the main repository directory.
