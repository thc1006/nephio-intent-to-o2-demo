# Comprehensive E2E Pipeline Test Report - All Edge Sites
**Test Date:** 2025-09-27T05:45-06:00 UTC
**Test Scope:** Full E2E pipeline testing across all 4 edge sites
**Test Type:** Production E2E pipeline (no --dry-run)

## Executive Summary

❌ **OVERALL FAILED** - All edge sites experienced critical failures in the kpt pipeline execution stage. While basic connectivity and initial pipeline stages succeeded across all sites, a systematic kpt version compatibility issue prevented successful deployments.

### Success Rate Overview
- **SSH Connectivity**: 100% (4/4 sites)
- **Intent Generation**: 100% (3/3 tested sites)
- **KRM Translation**: 100% (3/3 tested sites)
- **KRM Validation**: 67% (2/3 tested sites - edge4 failed due to missing directory)
- **KPT Pipeline Execution**: 0% (0/3 tested sites)
- **Overall E2E Success**: 0%

## Technical Analysis

### Root Cause: KPT Version Compatibility
**Primary Issue**: kpt version 1.0.0-beta.49 compatibility problems
- All sites using same kpt version
- Beta version may have stability/compatibility issues
- Pipeline fails at the final deployment stage consistently

### Secondary Issues Identified

#### Edge1 Specific:
- K3s service instability (activating state)
- TLS certificate verification errors
- API server not fully operational during test

#### Edge2 Specific:
- Prometheus service not deployed/accessible on port 30090
- Otherwise most stable cluster

#### Edge3 Specific:
- Sudo access restrictions limit full diagnostics
- User thc1006 requires password for privileged operations

#### Edge4 Specific:
- KRM resource directory missing (/rendered/krm/edge4)
- Validation stage skipped due to missing resources
- Configuration gap in template/resource generation

## Service Connectivity Matrix

| Site | SSH (22) | K8s API (6443) | Prometheus (30090) | O2IMS (31280) |
|------|----------|----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Edge1 | ✅ | ⚠️ (TLS issues) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Edge2 | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Edge3 | ✅ | ✅ | ❓ (access limited) | ❓ (access limited) |
| Edge4 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (via proxy) | ❓ (access limited) |

## Performance Metrics

### Pipeline Execution Times
- Edge1: 21.839s (slowest - due to long validation)
- Edge2: 18.073s (moderate)
- Edge4: 6.065s (fastest - early failure)

### Stage Performance Analysis
- Intent Generation: Consistently fast (6-9ms)
- KRM Translation: Fast (55-65ms)
- KRM Validation: Highly variable (3ms-20.6s)
- KPT Pipeline: 0ms (immediate failure)

## SLO Gate Analysis

❌ **ALL SLO GATES FAILED** - None of the sites reached the SLO validation stage

### Expected SLO Targets (from config):
- Pipeline latency P95: 60s ✅ (all under 22s)
- Pipeline latency P99: 90s ✅ (all under 22s)
- Success rate target: 99.5% ❌ (0% success)
- Edge connectivity uptime: 99.9% ✅ (SSH connectivity 100%)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)
1. **Upgrade KPT**: Replace beta version with stable release
2. **Fix Edge4 KRM Generation**: Investigate missing edge4 resource directory
3. **Stabilize Edge1**: Address K3s startup issues and certificate problems

### Short-term Improvements (Priority 2)
4. **Deploy Prometheus**: Ensure monitoring stack on edge2
5. **Access Management**: Configure passwordless sudo for edge3/edge4 monitoring
6. **Certificate Management**: Implement proper TLS certificate lifecycle

### Long-term Enhancements (Priority 3)
7. **Pipeline Resilience**: Add retry logic for transient failures
8. **Monitoring Integration**: Comprehensive service health monitoring
9. **Automated Recovery**: Self-healing deployment mechanisms

## Conclusion

While the edge infrastructure demonstrates good basic connectivity and the initial pipeline stages work correctly, the systematic kpt version compatibility issue prevents successful deployments across all sites. The infrastructure is fundamentally sound, but tooling updates are required for successful E2E operations.

**Next Steps**: Address kpt version compatibility as the highest priority, followed by site-specific configuration gaps, to achieve full E2E pipeline success.
