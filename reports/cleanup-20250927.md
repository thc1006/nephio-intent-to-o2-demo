## Changes Made

### 1. Archive Organization
- Created `archive/backups/` directory with organized subdirectories
- Preserved all backup files (moved, not deleted)
- Created comprehensive README.md in archive explaining contents

### 2. Git Ignore Updates
- Enhanced `.gitignore` to prevent future backup files from being committed
- Added patterns for `**/*_OLD.md` and `**/*_OLD.*` files
- Existing backup patterns `**/*.backup*` and `**/*.bak*` were already present

### 3. Documentation
- Created detailed README.md in `archive/backups/` explaining the purpose and organization
- Included restoration instructions for archived files

## Total Files Archived
- **6 backup files/directories** moved to organized archive
- **0 files deleted** (preservation policy followed)
- **1 README.md** created for documentation

## Benefits
- ✅ Cleaned up main project directories
- ✅ Preserved all backup files for potential restoration
- ✅ Organized files in logical directory structure
- ✅ Prevented future backup files from being committed to git
- ✅ Created clear documentation for archive contents

## Next Steps
- Archive is ready for long-term storage
- Main project directories are now cleaner and more organized
- Future backup files will be automatically ignored by git
- Archive can be referenced for restoration if needed
