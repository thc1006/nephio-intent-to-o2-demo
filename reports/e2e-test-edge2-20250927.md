# E2E Pipeline Test Report - Edge2 (172.16.4.176)
**Test Date:** 2025-09-27
**Pipeline ID:** e2e-1758951953
**Site:** edge2 (VM-4)
**Service Type:** enhanced-mobile-broadband

## Executive Summary
❌ **FAILED** - Pipeline completed stages 1-3 successfully but failed at kpt pipeline execution stage.

## Test Results

### 1. SSH Connectivity
✅ **PASS** - Successfully connected to edge2 (172.16.4.176)
- User: ubuntu
- Key: id_ed25519
- Hostname: project-vm
- IP Address: Corrected from 172.16.0.89 to 172.16.4.176

### 2. E2E Pipeline Execution
- **Start Time:** 2025-09-27T05:45:53Z
- **End Time:** 2025-09-27T05:46:11Z
- **Total Duration:** 18.073 seconds

#### Stage Results:
1. ✅ **Intent Generation** - 7ms - SUCCESS
2. ✅ **KRM Translation** - 55ms - SUCCESS
3. ✅ **KRM Validation** - 18.011s - SUCCESS (all 4 validators passed)
4. ❌ **KPT Pipeline** - 0ms - FAILED

### 3. Service Connectivity
✅ **PASS** - All critical services accessible:
- Port 22 (SSH): ✅ OPERATIONAL
- Port 6443 (Kubernetes API): ✅ OPERATIONAL
- Port 30090 (Prometheus): ❌ NOT LISTENING
- Port 31280 (O2IMS API): ✅ OPERATIONAL

### 4. Kubernetes Status
✅ **PASS** - K3s service operational
- K3s Status: active (running) since Mon 2025-09-15 17:57:43 UTC
- Uptime: 1 week 4 days
- API Server: Fully operational on port 6443

### 5. SLO Gate Analysis
❌ **FAILED** - Pipeline did not reach SLO validation stage due to kpt pipeline failure

## Technical Details

### KRM Validation Results
All 4 validators passed successfully:
- kubeval: PASS
- yaml-syntax: PASS
- naming-convention: PASS
- config-consistency: PASS

### Generated KRM Resources
- Multiple YAML files generated in /home/ubuntu/nephio-intent-to-o2-demo/rendered/krm/edge2/
- Include: ConfigMaps, NetworkSlices, ProvisioningRequests for both edge1 and edge2

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **KPT Pipeline Failure**: Same kpt version 1.0.0-beta.49 compatibility issues as edge1
2. **Prometheus Service**: Port 30090 not listening (service not deployed)
3. **Cluster Stable**: K3s cluster more stable than edge1

## Recommendations
1. Update kpt to stable version
2. Deploy Prometheus monitoring stack
3. Verify service port configurations
4. Test with manual kpt pipeline execution

## Metrics
- Pipeline Stages Completed: 3/4
- Validation Success Rate: 100% (for stages that ran)
- Service Connectivity: 75% (3/4 services operational)
- Cluster Stability: 100% (K3s fully operational)
- Overall Success: 0% (critical failure in deployment stage)
