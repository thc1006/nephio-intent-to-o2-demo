VM-1 Network Diagnostic Response
==============================
Date: $(date)
Response to: VM-4 connectivity issue

1. CORRECTED VM-1 Information:
   ✗ Expected IP: 172.16.0.2
   ✓ Actual IP: 172.16.0.78 (ens3 interface)
   ✓ Secondary IP: 192.168.0.47 (ens4 interface)

2. Service Status:
   ✓ Gitea running on port 3000
   ✓ Listening on all interfaces (0.0.0.0:3000)
   ✓ kubectl proxy on port 30000

3. Network Connectivity:
   ✗ Cannot ping VM-4 (172.16.0.89) - 100% packet loss
   ✓ Same network segment (172.16.0.0/16)
   ? Potential network isolation issue

4. Firewall Status:
   ✓ UFW: inactive
   ✓ iptables: Docker rules only, no blocking rules
   ✓ Port 3000 accessible

5. REQUIRED ACTIONS for VM-4:
   → Update connection target from 172.16.0.2 to 172.16.0.78
   → Test: curl http://172.16.0.78:3000
   → Verify VM-4 can reach updated IP

6. Network Investigation Needed:
   - Check if 172.16.0.89 is reachable from network
   - Verify no VLAN/subnet isolation
   - Check cloud provider security groups

IMMEDIATE FIX: Use 172.18.0.2:30924 instead of 172.16.0.2:3000

CONFIRMED WORKING ENDPOINTS:
✓ Internal Kind node: http://172.18.0.2:30924 (FULLY FUNCTIONAL)
✗ External host IP: http://172.16.0.78:3000 (Port mapping issue)

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
- Kind cluster runs on Docker network 172.18.0.0/16
- Gitea service uses NodePort 30924, not port 3000
- Port 3000 mapping exists but routes incorrectly
- Gitea pod is healthy and responding normally

TECHNICAL SOLUTION:
✅ Git HTTP protocol is FULLY FUNCTIONAL!

VM-4 SOLUTION - Repository Path Correction:
Wrong: http://172.16.0.78:30924/nephio/nephio-intent-to-o2-demo.git
Correct: http://172.18.0.2:30924/admin1/edge2-config.git

VERIFIED WORKING ENDPOINTS:
✅ Gitea Web UI: http://172.18.0.2:30924
✅ Git HTTP: http://172.18.0.2:30924/admin1/edge2-config.git
✅ Git ls-remote: SUCCESS (returns commit: 1f6fb7ecbf...)
✅ Git clone: SUCCESS (tested and verified)

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
1. ❌ Wrong user: "nephio" → ✅ Correct: "admin1"
2. ❌ Wrong repo: "nephio-intent-to-o2-demo" → ✅ Correct: "edge2-config"
3. ❌ Wrong IP: "172.16.0.78" → ✅ Correct: "172.18.0.2" (Kind internal)
4. ❌ Wrong port: Sometimes used 3000 → ✅ Correct: 30924 (NodePort)
